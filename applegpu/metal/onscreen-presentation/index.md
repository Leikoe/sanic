# Onscreen presentation

<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/onscreen-presentation>

Show the output from a GPU’s rendering pass to the user in your app.

## Overview

A texture contains visual data that you may want to display onscreen, such as a filtered image or a frame of animation in a game. To display a texture on a device’s screen, you need to create or acquire a drawable texture from [Core Animation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore).

In Metal, a *drawable* is a texture that bridges the display subsystem within [Core Animation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore) to Metal. You can use a drawable as the output of a render pass and then present it to a display with its [MTLDrawable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtldrawable) protocol.

> **Note:**
>  You can’t present a texture you directly create in Metal unless you copy its content to a drawable using a blit pass (see [Blit passes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/blit-passes)).

To display content on a device’s screen, add one of these to your Metal app:

- A [CAMetalLayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer) instance within a custom view class

- An [MTKView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MetalKit/MTKView) instance

With a [CAMetalLayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer) instance, your app can get drawable instances by calling its [nextDrawable()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer/nextDrawable()) method. Each drawable conforms to the [CAMetalDrawable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMetalDrawable) protocol, which has a [texture](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMetalDrawable/texture) property that a render pass can use as its output. See [Creating a custom Metal view](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/creating-a-custom-metal-view) for more information.

Alternatively, your app can use an [MTKView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MetalKit/MTKView) and its [currentDrawable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MetalKit/MTKView/currentDrawable) property. This [MetalKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MetalKit) class provides a default implementation of a Metal-aware view that uses an underlying [CAMetalLayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer) instance. A [MetalKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MetalKit) view provides a quick and easy way to present your app’s content, but gives you less control than using a [CAMetalLayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer) directly. See [Using Metal to draw a view’s contents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/using-metal-to-draw-a-view's-contents) for more information.

Whichever mechanism you choose, pay close attention to how your app handles drawables. Each drawable comes from a limited and reusable resource pool. A drawable may not always be available when your app requests one. When that happens, [Core Animation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore) blocks the calling thread until a drawable becomes available — usually at the display’s next refresh interval.

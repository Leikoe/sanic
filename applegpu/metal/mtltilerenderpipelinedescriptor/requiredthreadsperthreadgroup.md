## Declaration

```swift
var requiredThreadsPerThreadgroup: MTLSize { get set }
```

## Discussion

Sets the required threads-per-threadgroup during tile dispatches. The `threadsPerTile` argument of any tile dispatch must match to this value if it is set. Setting this to a size of 0 in every dimension disables this property

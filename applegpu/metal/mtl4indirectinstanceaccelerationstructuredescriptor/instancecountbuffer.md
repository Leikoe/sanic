Provides a reference to a buffer containing the number of instances in the instance descriptor buffer, formatted as a 32-bit unsigned integer.

## Declaration

```swift
var instanceCountBuffer: MTL4BufferRange { get set }
```

## Discussion

You are responsible for ensuring that the final number of instances at build time, which you provide indirectly via this buffer reference , is less than or equal to the value of property [maxInstanceCount](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtl4indirectinstanceaccelerationstructuredescriptor/maxinstancecount).

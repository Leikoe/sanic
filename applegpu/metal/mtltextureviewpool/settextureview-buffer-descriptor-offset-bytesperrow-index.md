<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtltextureviewpool/settextureview(buffer:descriptor:offset:bytesperrow:index:)>

Creates a new lightweight texture view of a buffer.

## Declaration

```swift
func setTextureView(buffer: any MTLBuffer, descriptor: MTLTextureDescriptor, offset: Int, bytesPerRow: Int, index: Int) -> MTLResourceID
```

## Parameters

- **buffer** — An [MTLBuffer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlbuffer) instance for which to create a new texture view.
- **descriptor** — A descriptor specifying properties of the texture view to create.
- **offset** — A byte offset, within the `buffer` parameter, at which the data for the texture view starts.
- **bytesPerRow** — The number of bytes between adjacent rows of pixels in the source buffer’s memory.
- **index** — An index of a slot in the table into which this method writes the new texture view.

## Return Value

The [MTLResourceID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlresourceid) of a new buffer view in this pool.

## Discussion

This method creates a lightweight texture view over a buffer, according to a descriptor you provide. It then associates the texture view with a slot in this texture view pool at the index you specify.

# MTLPixelFormat.bgra10_xr_srgb

*Case · iOS 10.0, iPadOS 10.0, Mac Catalyst 14.0, macOS 11.0, tvOS 10.0, visionOS 1.0*

<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlpixelformat/bgra10_xr_srgb>

A 64-bit extended-range pixel format with sRGB conversion and four fixed-point components of 10-bit blue, 10-bit green, 10-bit red, and 10-bit alpha.

## Declaration

```swift
case bgra10_xr_srgb
```

## Discussion

Pixel components are in blue, green, red, and alpha order, from least significant bit to most significant bit. Each component is a 16-bit chunk arranged as follows:

- The 10 most significant bits (9–15) store the component’s data.

- The 6 least significant bits (0–5) bits are padding, and their value is `0`.

The blue, green, and red components are gamma encoded, and their values range from `-0.5271` to `1.66894`, before gamma expansion. The alpha component is always clamped to a `[0.0, 1.0]` range in sampling, rendering, and writing operations, despite supporting values outside this range.

In order to determine a component’s value as a shader float:

- When reading a pixel, first apply the linear encoding `(xr10_value - 384) / 510.0f` and then the sRGB transform.

- When writing a pixel, first apply the sRGB transform and then the linear encoding `shader_float = (xr10_value - 384) / 510.0f`.

To display wide color values on devices with wide color displays, you set this pixel format on the [colorPixelFormat](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MetalKit/MTKView/colorPixelFormat) property of an [MTKView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MetalKit/MTKView) or the [pixelFormat](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer/pixelFormat) property of a [CAMetalLayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer). Also provide an extended sRGB color space.

> **Note:**
>  Only devices with a wide color display can display color values outside the `[0.0, 1.0]` range; all other devices clamp color values to the `[0.0, 1.0]` range.

# MTLPixelFormat.bgra10_xr

*Case · iOS 10.0, iPadOS 10.0, Mac Catalyst 14.0, macOS 11.0, tvOS 10.0, visionOS 1.0*

<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlpixelformat/bgra10_xr>

A 64-bit extended-range pixel format with four fixed-point components of 10-bit blue, 10-bit green, 10-bit red, and 10-bit alpha.

## Declaration

```swift
case bgra10_xr
```

## Discussion

Pixel components are in blue, green, red, and alpha order, from least significant bit to most significant bit (little-endian order). Each component is a 16-bit chunk arranged as follows:

- The 10 most-significant bits (bits 6–15) store the component’s data.

- The 6 least-significant bits (bits 0–5) are padding, and their value is `0`.

The blue, green, and red components are linearly encoded in a transform from `[0,2^10)` to [`-0.752941, 1.25098]`. The formula used in this linear encoding is `shader_float = (xr10_value - 384) / 510.0f`.

> **Tip:**
>  Each UNorm8-based pixel value has an exact corresponding value in the XR10 pixel range, given by `xr10_value = unorm8_value * 2 + 384`.

The alpha component is always clamped to a `[0.0, 1.0]` range in sampling, rendering, and writing operations, despite supporting values outside this range.

To display wide color values on devices with wide color displays, set this pixel format on the [colorPixelFormat](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MetalKit/MTKView/colorPixelFormat) property of an [MTKView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MetalKit/MTKView) or the [pixelFormat](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer/pixelFormat) property of a [CAMetalLayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer).

> **Note:**
>  Only devices with a wide color display can display color values outside the `[0.0, 1.0]` range; all other devices clamp color values to the `[0.0, 1.0]` range.

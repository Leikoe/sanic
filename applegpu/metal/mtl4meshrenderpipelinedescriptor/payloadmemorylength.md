Reserves storage for the object-to-mesh stage payload.

## Declaration

```swift
var payloadMemoryLength: Int { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property determines the size, in bytes, of the buffer you indicate via the Metal Shading Language `[[payload]]` attribute in the object and mesh shader functions of the mesh render pipeline.

If this value is `0`, Metal derives the size from the (dereferenced) type you declare for the payload in the object shader function. If the type is a pointer, Metal reserves space for a single element.

The default value is `0`.

# peerGroupID

*Instance Property · macOS 10.15*

<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtldevice/peergroupid>

The peer group ID the GPU belongs to, if applicable.

## Declaration

```swift
var peerGroupID: UInt64 { get }
```

## Discussion

A group ID value of `0` indicates the GPU isn’t in a peer group. Otherwise, the GPU is in a peer group and the value is the group’s ID. All other GPUs in the same peer group have the same group ID.

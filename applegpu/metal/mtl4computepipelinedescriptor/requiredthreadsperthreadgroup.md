<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtl4computepipelinedescriptor/requiredthreadsperthreadgroup>

The required number of threads per threadgroup for compute dispatches.

## Declaration

```swift
var requiredThreadsPerThreadgroup: MTLSize { get set }
```

## Discussion

When you set this value, you are responsible for ensuring that the `threadsPerThreadgroup` argument of any compute dispatch matches it.

Setting this property is optional, except in cases where the pipeline uses *CooperativeTensors*.

This property’s default value is `0`, which disables its effect.

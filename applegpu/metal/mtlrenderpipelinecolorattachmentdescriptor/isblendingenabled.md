A Boolean value that determines whether blending is enabled.

## Declaration

```swift
var isBlendingEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/false), meaning blending is disabled and pixel values are unaffected by blending. Disabled blending is effectively the same as the `MTLBlendOperationAdd` blend operation with a source blend factor of `1.0` and a destination blend factor of `0.0` for both RGB and alpha.

If the value is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/true), blending is enabled and the blend descriptor property values are used to determine how source and destination color values are combined.

### Controlling blend operations
- [alphaBlendOperation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlrenderpipelinecolorattachmentdescriptor/alphablendoperation) — The blend operation assigned for the alpha data.
- [rgbBlendOperation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlrenderpipelinecolorattachmentdescriptor/rgbblendoperation) — The blend operation assigned for the RGB data.
- [MTLBlendOperation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlblendoperation) — For every pixel, `MTLBlendOperation` determines how to combine and weight the source fragment values with the destination values. Some blend operations multiply the source values by a source blend factor (SBF), multiply the destination values by a destination blend factor (DBF), and then combine the results using addition or subtraction. Other blend operations use either a minimum or maximum function to determine the result.

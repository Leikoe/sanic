<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlaccelerationstructurepasssamplebufferattachmentdescriptor/samplebuffer>

A specialized memory buffer that the GPU uses to store its counter data during the acceleration structure pass.

## Declaration

```swift
var sampleBuffer: (any MTLCounterSampleBuffer)? { get set }
```

## Discussion

The property defaults to `nil`, which means the GPU doesn’t save any GPU counter information during the acceleration structure pass. See [Creating a counter sample buffer to store a GPU’s counter data during a pass](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/creating-a-counter-sample-buffer-to-store-a-gpus-counter-data-during-a-pass) and [Sampling GPU data into counter sample buffers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/sampling-gpu-data-into-counter-sample-buffers) for more information.

Indicates support for sparse buffers tier 1.

## Declaration

```swift
case tier1
```

## Discussion

Tier 1 sparse buffers allow the following:

- Partial memory backing at sparse page granularity.

- Defined behavior for accessing an *unbacked* buffer range.

An unbacked buffer range indicates a range within the buffer that doesn’t have memory backing at a given point in time. Accessing an unbacked buffer range of a sparse buffer produces the following results:

- Reading return zero.

- Writing produces no result.

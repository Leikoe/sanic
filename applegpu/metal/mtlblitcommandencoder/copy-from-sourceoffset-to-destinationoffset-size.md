<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlblitcommandencoder/copy(from:sourceoffset:to:destinationoffset:size:)>

Encodes a command that copies data from one buffer into another.

## Declaration

```swift
func copy(from sourceBuffer: any MTLBuffer, sourceOffset: Int, to destinationBuffer: any MTLBuffer, destinationOffset: Int, size: Int)
```

## Parameters

- **sourceBuffer** — A buffer the command copies data from.
- **sourceOffset** — A byte offset within `sourceBuffer` the command copies from. In macOS, `sourceOffset` needs to be a multiple of `4`, but can be any value in iOS and tvOS.
- **destinationBuffer** — The destination buffer for the copy operation.
- **destinationOffset** — A byte offset within `destinationBuffer` the command copies to. In macOS, `destinationOffset` needs to be a multiple of `4`, but can be any value in iOS and tvOS.
- **size** — The number of bytes the command copies from `sourceBuffer` to `destinationBuffer`. In macOS, `size` needs to be a multiple of `4`, but can be any value in iOS and tvOS.

## Discussion

You can pass the same buffer to the `sourceBuffer` and `destinationBuffer` parameters if `size` is less than the distance between `sourceOffset` and `destinationOffset`.

> **Important:**
>  Copying data to overlapping regions within the same buffer may result in unexpected behavior.

## Discussion

Drawable objects are usually owned by some other object, such as a [CAMetalLayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer). The owning object gives the first drawable it creates an ID of `0`, and it increments the ID by `1` for each additional drawable it creates.

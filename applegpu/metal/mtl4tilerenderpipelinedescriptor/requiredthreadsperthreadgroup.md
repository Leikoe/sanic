Sets the required number of threads per threadgroup for tile dispatches.

## Declaration

```swift
var requiredThreadsPerThreadgroup: MTLSize { get set }
```

## Discussion

This value is typically optional, except in the cases where the tile function that [tileFunctionDescriptor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtl4tilerenderpipelinedescriptor/tilefunctiondescriptor) references uses `CooperativeTensors`. In this case, you need to provide a non-zero value to this property.

Additionally, when you set this value, the `threadsPerTile` argument of any tile dispatch needs to match it.

Setting this value to a size of 0 in every dimension disables this property.

The GPU has permission to discard the rendered contents of the attachment at the end of the render pass, replacing them with arbitrary data.

## Declaration

```swift
case dontCare
```

## Discussion

Use this option when you need the attachment’s contents during the render pass but not afterwards. Some GPUs may still store the contents back to the texture, but you can’t rely on that behavior. You need to assume that GPU discarded the texture’s contents.

### Store actions
- [MTLStoreAction.store](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlstoreaction/store) — The GPU stores the rendered contents to the texture.
- [MTLStoreAction.multisampleResolve](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlstoreaction/multisampleresolve) — The GPU resolves the multisampled data to one sample per pixel and stores the data to the resolve texture, discarding the multisample data afterwards.
- [MTLStoreAction.storeAndMultisampleResolve](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlstoreaction/storeandmultisampleresolve) — The GPU stores the multisample data to the multisample texture, resolves the data to a sample per pixel, and stores the data to the resolve texture.
- [MTLStoreAction.unknown](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlstoreaction/unknown) — The system selects a store action when it encodes the render pass.
- [MTLStoreAction.customSampleDepthStore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlstoreaction/customsampledepthstore) — The GPU stores depth data in a sample-position–agnostic representation.

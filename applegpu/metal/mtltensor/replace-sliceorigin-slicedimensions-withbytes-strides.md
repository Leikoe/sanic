<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtltensor/replace(sliceorigin:slicedimensions:withbytes:strides:)>

Replaces a slice of the data plane of this tensor with data from a pointer you provide.

## Declaration

```swift
func replace(sliceOrigin: MTLTensorExtents, sliceDimensions: MTLTensorExtents, withBytes bytes: UnsafeRawPointer, strides: MTLTensorExtents)
```

## Parameters

- **sliceOrigin** — An array of per-dimension offsets that together locate the first element to write to in the tensor. Each element in this array corresponds to the dimension at the same index in `sliceDimensions`. Each offset value represents the number of elements from the start of that dimension.
- **sliceDimensions** — An array of per-dimension sizes that together define the extent of the slice to write to in the tensor. Each element in this array corresponds to the dimension at the same index in `sliceOrigin`. Each size value represents the number of elements to include along that dimension, starting from the corresponding offset in `sliceOrigin`.
- **bytes** — A pointer to bytes of data to copy into the slice.
- **strides** — An array of strides, in elements, that describes the layout of the data in `bytes`.

## Discussion

Create the tensor with [storageModeShared](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlresourceoptions/storagemodeshared) for CPU access via this method.

Strides need to be monotonically non-decreasing: for any `i > 0`, `strides[i] >= strides[i-1] * dimensions[i-1]`.

The first dimension of `sliceOrigin` and `sliceDimensions` needs to be byte aligned.

Indicates support for sparse textures tier 1.

## Declaration

```swift
case tier1
```

## Discussion

Tier 1 sparse textures allow the following:

- Partial memory backing at sparse tile granularity.

- Defined behavior for accessing an unbacked texture region.

- Shader feedback on texture access to determine memory backing.

An unbacked texture region indicates a region within the texture that doesn’t have memory backing at a given point in time. Accessing an unbacked texture region produces the following results:

- Reading returns zero (transparent black) for pixel formats with an alpha (A) channel.

- Reading return zero in RGB and one in alpha (A) channels (opaque black) otherwise.

- Writing produces no result.

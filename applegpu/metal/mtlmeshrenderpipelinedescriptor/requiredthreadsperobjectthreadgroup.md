## Declaration

```swift
var requiredThreadsPerObjectThreadgroup: MTLSize { get set }
```

## Discussion

Sets the required object threads-per-threadgroup during mesh draws. The `threadsPerObjectThreadgroup` argument of any draw must match to this value if it is set. Setting this to a size of 0 in every dimension disables this property

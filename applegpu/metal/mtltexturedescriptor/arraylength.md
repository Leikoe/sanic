<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtltexturedescriptor/arraylength>

The number of array elements for this texture.

## Declaration

```swift
var arrayLength: Int { get set }
```

## Discussion

The value of this property needs to be between `1` and `2048`, inclusive. The default value is `1`.

This value is `1` if the texture type is not an array.

This value can be between `1` and `2048` if the texture type is one of the following array types:

- [MTLTextureType.type1DArray](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtltexturetype/type1darray)

- [MTLTextureType.type2DArray](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtltexturetype/type2darray)

- [MTLTextureType.type2DMultisampleArray](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtltexturetype/type2dmultisamplearray)

- [MTLTextureType.typeCubeArray](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtltexturetype/typecubearray)

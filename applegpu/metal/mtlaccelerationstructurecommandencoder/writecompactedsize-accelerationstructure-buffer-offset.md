<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlaccelerationstructurecommandencoder/writecompactedsize(accelerationstructure:buffer:offset:)>

Encodes a command to calculate the compacted size of an acceleration structure.

## Declaration

```swift
func writeCompactedSize(accelerationStructure: any MTLAccelerationStructure, buffer: any MTLBuffer, offset: Int)
```

## Parameters

- **accelerationStructure** — The acceleration structure to measure.
- **buffer** — The buffer to write the size into.
- **offset** — An offset, in bytes, where the GPU should write the result.

## Discussion

The GPU writes the compacted size to the buffer as a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the compacted size in bytes. The compacted size may be smaller than the source acceleration structure.

To compact an acceleration structure, encode a command to get the minimum size. After the command completes, read the size from the buffer and allocate a new acceleration structure with at least that much storage. Then create another encoder and call the  [copyAndCompact(sourceAccelerationStructure:destinationAccelerationStructure:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlaccelerationstructurecommandencoder/copyandcompact(sourceaccelerationstructure:destinationaccelerationstructure:)) method to copy it into the new structure.

Marks the end of a debug group and, if applicable, restores the previous group from a stack.

## Declaration

```swift
func popDebugGroup()
```

## Discussion

Use [pushDebugGroup(_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcommandbuffer/pushdebuggroup(_:)) to group commands within the command buffer, which adds a new group to a stack, effectively nesting a group within any previous group. Call [popDebugGroup()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcommandbuffer/popdebuggroup()) to mark the end of a group of commands within the command buffer, and restore the previous group, if applicable. You can inspect the group and the commands it contains when viewing the contents of a frame capture with Metal Debugger.

Labels can help you profile and debug your app at runtime with Metal Debugger and other tools. See [Naming resources and commands](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/Naming-resources-and-commands) for more information about using labels and other debugging techniques.

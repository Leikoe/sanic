Stops capturing Metal commands.

## Declaration

```swift
func stopCapture()
```

## Discussion

Calling this method stops a capture that was started manually in Xcode or programmatically by calling one of the methods on [MTLCaptureManager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturemanager).

When using a custom capture scope, calling this function preempts any [end()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturescope/end()) demarcations of the capture scope.

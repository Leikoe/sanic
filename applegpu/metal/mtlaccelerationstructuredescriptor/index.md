<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlaccelerationstructuredescriptor>

A base class for classes that define the configuration for a new acceleration structure.

## Declaration

```swift
class MTLAccelerationStructureDescriptor
```

## Overview

This is the base class for other acceleration structure descriptors. Don’t use this class directly. Use one of the derived classes instead, as [MTLAccelerationStructure](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlaccelerationstructure) describes.

Sets the stride, in bytes, between control points in the control point buffer the control point buffer references.

## Declaration

```swift
var controlPointStride: Int { get set }
```

## Discussion

You are responsible for ensuring this stride is a multiple of the control point format’s element size, and at a minimum exactly the control point format’s size.

This property defaults to `0`, indicating that the control points are tightly-packed.
